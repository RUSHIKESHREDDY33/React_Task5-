Hello, my name is Rushikesh Reddy, and I am a passionate web designer and developer with proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies. Throughout my career, I have successfully completed various challenging projects. One of my notable achievements includes the development of a robust e-commerce platform, similar to the functionality of Flipkart, incorporating a user-friendly interface and secure payment gateway. Also in creating a social media platform resembling the features of Twitter, focusing on real-time updates and engaging user interactions. These projects reflect my dedication to crafting dynamic and innovative web solutions that meet the demands of today's digital landscape.      </p>
